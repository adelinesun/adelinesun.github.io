Staying up to date with the literature helps inform experimental design, practice problem solving, and spark new and disruptive hypotheses about science. How can someone read literature in a way that's effective toward their own research, rather than being reductive? 

**People read papers differently based on their objectives. These are mine.**
1. Stay informed about the current research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.
2. Improve my ability to parse through dense information, draw and judge conclusions based on data, and write cleanly.
3. Learn from other researchers, theorycraft, and back up my intrigue for science through effort.
